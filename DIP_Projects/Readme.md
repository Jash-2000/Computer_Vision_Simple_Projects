## Different Assignments done for learning OpenCV in MATLAB

1. Reading Images and converting the rgb image to grayscale. Applying Bitlogic to the grayscaled images.
2. Applying Histogram equalization to the images and observing the contrast changes.
3. Image Entropy calculation and IGS compression algorithm.
4. Huffman compression Algorithm and entropy analysis.
5. Thresholding of images
6. Binary Thresholding and Masking of images
7. Pixel level shape analysis. Plotting the angle to distance of the shapes.
8. Voxelization of shapes
